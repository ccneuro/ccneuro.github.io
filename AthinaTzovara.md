#### Bio
My research uses invasive and scalp electrophysiological recordings, in combination with computational modeling and machine learning techniques, to study human cognition. I am particularly interested on how we detect regularities and statistical rules in sensory stimuli, and how we use those to form predictions about future events, as a function of consciousness. In the past, I have been investigating the neural and computational mechanisms underlying associative learning in humans and the neural mechanisms underlying the formation of auditory predictions in coma patients. 

In paralel to my research at the University of Bern, I am affiliated as a visiting scholar with the University of California, Berkeley, USA, in the laboratory of [Robert T. Knight](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, in the lab of [Dominik R. Bach](http://bachlab.org/), and an honorary research associate at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/), University College London, UK. I completed my PhD at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), in the group of [Marzia De Lucia](https://sites.google.com/view/marziadelucia/home).
