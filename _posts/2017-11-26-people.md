My research at the University of Bern uses electrophysiological and computational techniques to study human cognition. I am particularly interested on how we detect regularities and statistical rules in sensory stimuli, and how we use those to form predictions about future events, as a function of our levels of consciousness. 
In the past, I have been investigating the neural and computational mechanisms underlying associative learning in humans and the neural mechanisms underlying the formation of auditory predictions in coma patients.

To study human cognition, I am using imaging (EEG, MEG, ECoG) and psychophysiological techniques (skin conductance, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12801/full">pupil size</a>, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12775/full">startle responses</a>), in combination with <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320311001440">machine learning</a> and <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006243">modeling approaches</a>. My goal is to characterise the neural and computational mechanisms which allow healthy individuals to perceive their environment and ultimately, to examine how these are disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness.
