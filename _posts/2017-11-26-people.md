<br/>
My research uses invasive and scalp electrophysiological recordings, in combination with computational modeling and machine learning techniques, to study human cognition. I am particularly interested on how we detect regularities and statistical rules in sensory stimuli, and how we use those to form predictions about future events, as a function of consciousness. 
In the past, I have been investigating the neural and computational mechanisms underlying associative learning in humans and the neural mechanisms underlying the formation of auditory predictions in coma patients.

<br/>
In paralel to my research at the University of Bern, I am affiliated as a visiting scholar with the University of California, Berkeley, USA, in the laboratory of [Prof. Robert T. Knight](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, in the lab of [Prof. Dominik Bach](http://bachlab.org/), and an honorary research associate at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/), University College London, UK. I completed my PhD at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), in the group of [Dr. Marzia De Lucia](https://sites.google.com/view/marziadelucia/home).
