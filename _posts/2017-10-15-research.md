Our research uses computational and machine learning techniques to study cognition, in particular in cases where cosncious access to the environment is lost, such as during sleep. Our current endeavours centre around two main topics:

* [Sensory learning and predictions](#sensory-learning-predictions)
* [Machine learning techniques for analysing EEG data](#machine-learning-techniques-for-physiological-data)

## Sensory learning and predictions

The world around us is full of rich sensory experiences, which often follow repetitive rules. For example, temporal
regularities, like the time of the day, might allow us to foresee and avoid subsequent traffic jams, or auditory events,
like the sound of a siren, could help us predict the arrival of an ambulance, or a fire truck. Through exposure to
reoccurring events we are able to learn patterns and eventually form predictions about future events before these
occur. These predictions occur not only in active conditions, i.e. when they are relevant to our actions, but also when conscious access to incoming sensory stimuli can be excluded, i.e. during sleep or even coma.

To study how we learn from reoccuring environmental events, we use electrophysiological recordings (scalp, intracranial EEG and human single unit activity) in combination with computational modeling (multivariate decoding, learning models).

## Machine learning techniques for physiological data

Studying neural responses to environmental stimuli through electroencephalography (EEG), typically requires averaging hundrents or thousands of single-trial responses, and contrasting them at single electrode locations. Multivariate decoding techniques are typically used to model the distribution of single-trial EEG responses across the scalp, and extract topographic EEG responses in a data-driven way. These techniques can be used to model data at the [single-patient](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027014003872) level, to decode [decisions from EEG responses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001632), or to test the role of [temporal intervals in processing environmental stimuli](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001589).
