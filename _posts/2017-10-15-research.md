Our research uses computational and machine learning techniques to study cognition, in particular in cases where cosncious access to the environment is lost, such as during sleep. Our current endeavours centre around two main topics:

* [Forming predictions in wakefulness and sleep](#sensory-predictions)
* [Machine learning techniques for analysing EEG data](#machine-learning)
* [Source reconstruction of MEG data](#source-reconstruction)
